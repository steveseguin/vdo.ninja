# \&groupaudio

## Aliases

\&ga

## Details

This just enables the guest or scene to not filter out audio streams that are contained in other sub-groups.

By default a stream assigned to one group won't be visible or audible to those in another group. `&groupaudio` prevents audio from being filtered, but keeps the video filtering in place.
