# Where can I get support?

The preferred support mechanism is via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/feenJm8HTa), which offer community-assisted support. Development issues, feature requests, and bugs are tracked on [Github](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja). For mission critical support issues, or business-related inquiries, you can contact Steve directly.
