# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure the long-term viability of this project, and for the protection of its creator and its users, we request that contributors to the project first agree to some basic terms. The terms when accepted applies to all of your past, present and future contributions.

# Contribution Policy

You are invited to digitally sign the CLA with the provided CLA Assissant service, with a link to sign it provided automatically after contributing to this Github project. You may also print, sign, scan, and then email the CLA to steve@seguin.email.  

It is not required that you sign the CLA for every contribution. Once you execute a CLA, it is valid until the CLA agreement is meaningfully changed and requires updating.

If you are contributing on behalf of your company, an officer of your company (usually a VP or higher title) must sign the CLA on behalf of the company, indicating his or her title. The company can choose to list the specific individuals authorized to make contributions on the "Full Name" line, or may cover all employees with a blanket CLA by not limiting contributors to an authorized list. If necessary, the company may provide a list of authorized contributors in an attachment. The executive signing the CLA must be the first name on such an attached list, and this executive must sign the attachment as well. It may well be the case that your company already has signed a company-wide CLA with Stephen Seguin. Please check this first.

You can stop your participation in a project at any time, but you cannot rescind your assignments or grants with respect to prior contributions.

You hereby grant Steve Seguin (Steve) a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and transferable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute the submissions, and to sublicense such rights to others. The rights granted may be exercised in any form or format, and Steve may distribute and sublicense to others on any licensing terms, including without limitation: (a) open source licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL), or the Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD); or (b) binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses.

You hereby represent that you are the sole and original author of all Submissions and that, to the best of your knowledge, the submissions do not infringe upon the rights of any third party.

You agree to these terms with your continued submission.
