# VDO.Ninja Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure the long-term viability of the open-source VDO.Ninja project, and for the protection of its creator and its users, we request that contributors to the project first agree to some basic terms. The terms when accepted applies to all of your past, present and future contributions.

# Contribution Policy

Contributions that only take 20 lines of code or less will have its Intellectual Property implicitly transferred to Stephen Seguin, the creator of VDO.Ninja. You agree with this rule by pushing your code or works to github, by sending the code or works to one of VDO.Ninja's core developers, or by distributing your code or works in any other way.

For all code contributions that take more than 20 lines, you are invited to digitally sign the CLA with the provided CLA Assissant service. You may also print, sign, scan, and then email the CLA to steve@seguin.email.

It is not required that you sign the CLA for every contribution. Once you execute a CLA, it is valid until the CLA agreement is meaningfully changed and requires updating.

## Important notice
If you are contributing on behalf of your company, an officer of your company (usually a VP or higher title) must sign the CLA on behalf of the company, indicating his or her title. The company can choose to list the specific individuals authorized to make contributions on the "Full Name" line, or may cover all employees with a blanket CLA by not limiting contributors to an authorized list. If necessary, the company may provide a list of authorized contributors in an attachment. The executive signing the CLA must be the first name on such an attached list, and this executive must sign the attachment as well. It may well be the case that your company already has signed a company-wide CLA with Stephen Seguin. Please check this first.

You can stop your participation in a project at any time, but you cannot rescind your assignments or grants with respect to prior contributions. This protects the whole community, allowing Stephen Seguin and downstream users of the code base to rely on it.
