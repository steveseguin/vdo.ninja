# Can't screen share Adobe Lightroom

**Disable Hardware Acceleration:**

* Sometimes, hardware acceleration in either Chrome or Lightroom can cause issues. Try disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome by going to `chrome://settings` > Advanced > System > uncheck "Use hardware acceleration when available". Also, check if there's an option to disable hardware acceleration in Lightroom

**Try a Different Browser:**

* Test if the issue persists with other browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge. This can help determine if the problem is specific to Chrome.

**Use Windowed Mode:**

* If Lightroom is in full-screen mode, try switching to windowed mode. Some applications don't share their display properly when in full-screen.

**Use Display Capture in Chrome instead of Window Capture**

* While this option may reveal more of your desktop than desired, if using a secondary screen to host the Lightroom application, it may still be a suitable solution.

**Use OBS and it's Virtual Camera:**

* You can use OBS to capture lightroom, and from there output it to VDO.Ninja via the OBS Virtual Camera.  You would select the virtual camera in VDO.Ninjas a camera source, instead of a screen share source.  OBS has more advanced screen capture options than Chrome does.
