{% endembed %}

* Created a page called "Comms", which is designed for audio-only production.
* You can select which "group" you want to be a part of via the top bar, where those in your group can hear you and vice versa.
* If you aren't in a group, you hear everyone.
* Compatible with [`&groups`](../general-settings/and-group.md) with VDO.Ninja as normal; it's just a custom layout stylized/tweaked for audio-only production comms.
* There's a few URL parameters you can set, including [`&push`](../source-settings/push.md), [`&label`](../general-settings/label.md), [`&room`](../general-settings/room.md), [`&password`](../general-settings/password.md), and [`&groups`](../general-settings/and-group.md).
* If you use `&groups=group1,groupb,etc`, new group buttons will appear.
* By default, groups 1 to 6 are there.
* If you use `&groups=1,2,3` , you'll auto-join groups 1, 2 and 3.
