# Other Parameters

There are some more parameters on [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) which are currently not ready for production, not intended to be used, or not well-documented.

| Parameter            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `&crop`              | <p>Changes the aspect ratio on the publisher side, but lets you pass an integer value to represent a percentile cropping value.<br><br>So, <code>&#x26;crop=10</code> will reduce the width by 90% and <code>&#x26;crop=-10</code> will increase the aspect ratio. The assumed base aspect ratio is 16:9.</p> |

| `&showheader`        | Forces the header bar to show even if using [`&cleanoutput`](advanced-settings/design-parameters/cleanoutput.md) for example                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The default value is balanced.                                                                                                                                              |

| `&micsamplerate`     | Lets you specify the capture audio sample rate. Also added purely for experimental reasons; I don't recommend touching.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
