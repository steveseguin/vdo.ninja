# \&r2d2

## Details

Add this to a guest's/director's URL and you get R2-D2 audio alerts for raised-hands, chat messages.

Same as [`&notify`](and-notify.md). If there is no sound when a guest is joining or leaving the room, use `&notify&r2d2` to get a basic sound.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you can't hear a sound, click any button in the room. Then the sounds will be activated.
{% endhint %}
