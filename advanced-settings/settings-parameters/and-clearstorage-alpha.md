# \&clearstorage (alpha)

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))\
\*only available on [vdo.ninja/alpha](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Aliases

* `&clear`

## Details

`&clearstorage` will clear all the saved user preferences for all sessions, including [`&sticky`](../../general-settings/sticky.md)'d data, director settings, any camera and microphone settings, and probably a couple other small things. This also includes the "default" saved stated of camera settings before adjusted.

I also added a button to manually do this via the User menu settings.\
