# Edit an invite after sending it

You can use services like [https://short.io](https://short.io) to create aliases of your invite links, leveraging those service platforms to also keep track of invites you have sent out, how many times they have been opened, and also change the VDO.Ninja settings contained in the invite after sending it.

VDO.Ninja lets you move guests between room and change the URL of a guest after they have connected, but it doesn't offer services itself that let you change the URL before the user has connected.

I have no relation to Short.io; it's just what service I happen to use.  There are plenty of other options out there.
